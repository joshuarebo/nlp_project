# NLP Spam Detection Project

This project is an NLP system for spam detection using various machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, and a Neural Network.

## Running the Project

1. **Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Run the `spam_detection.ipynb` notebook to execute the code step-by-step.

3. **Neural Network**: The neural network code can be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for better compatibility.
